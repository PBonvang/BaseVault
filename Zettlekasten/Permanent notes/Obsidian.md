At its core Obsidian is an open source markdown editor with an underlying graph database. This allows obsidian to be a graph based note taking system so you can model your notes as a wiki or in the [[Zettlekasten]] structure.

What's great about obsidian is its freedom to structure your notes as you like. Like any project management setup, note taking is a personal process and no one structure fits everyone. 
Prefer handwritten notes, but wish you could expand on them and link them to your other notes? Great install the [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) plugin.
Would like to place a note in multiple subjects? No problem just link to all of them in the note or from the subjects.
Like to make structured todo lists? Install the [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) plugin.

The beauty of Obsidian is the community around it. If you feel like some functionality is missing there's probably a community plugin which implements it.
