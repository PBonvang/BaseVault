Fleeting notes are the notes taking when you receive the information. It's the note you made quickly during a conversation, lecture notes and in the [[Zettlekasten]] system also [[Literature notes]].
The purpose of fleeting notes is to remind yourself of the key concepts and ideas of some information. Might it be an inspiration for a new project, an understanding of a new concept or generally something you want to remember, but don't have the time to dig into at the current moment.

Fleeting notes are called fleeting because the knowledge they contain will disappear if not implemented into the rest of your network. Fleeting notes are not structured or easy to read, they thus need to be reviewed at a later time and transformed into a [[Permanent notes|permanent note]]. In this transformation the knowledge and ideas contained in the fleeting note, is implemented in the standard format of the specific note type. And connected to existing concepts, embedding the new concept in the your existing knowledge increasing memorization.
"So you're saying I have to make notes twice!?"
Ever notice how easy it is to write about something you know by heart? Or thinking you understand a concept  till you have to explain it?
This transformation process both ensures that your [[Permanent notes]] remain easily searchable by standardization, and check your comprehension of the concept. This can be a little challenging at first, but the outcome of this deeper and ensured understanding of the concepts, will quickly show and motivate you. Exercises, reports and essays are easy once you know the concepts deeply, thus the extra time you spent truly understanding concepts is regained once the concepts needs to be used, which is after all the true purpose of knowledge; Knowing how to use it.

How you keep fleeting notes is truly a personal preference. If you like having a physical notebook in your pocket at all time, do that. Have a great note taking app use that. The only important feature of where you store your fleeting notes, is that it should be easy and quick to take notes in. If you don't feel like taking the note, you need to find another way. This concept is what in [[Zettlekasten]] terms is referred to as a *slip box*.

It's recommended that you go though your fleeting notes once a day. As fleeting notes are quick notes, they're usually not very informative, and thus to make the transformation into permanent notes as easy as possible, it's better to do this transformation while you still remember the situation you took the note in.
