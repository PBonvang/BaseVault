Subjects: [[Smart notes]]
****

# Principles
1. Everything is connected: It should be possible to get from any note in your [[critical mass]] to any other note
2. Multisubject notes: Group notes by linking to their subjects or making [[MOC - Map Of Content|MOCs]]
3. [[Ghost notes|Ghost links]]: Link to concepts even though their note doesn't exist
4. References: Link to references and sources of this 

## 1 - Everything is connected
<span class="centerImg">![[VaultGraphMatStatExample.png]]</span>
Studies show that comprehension and memorization is greatly increased by linking new concepts/understanding to existing knowledge. We therefore seek to link new notes to our already existing notes in a meaningful way. 
A good way to ensure this, we seek to be able to get from any note to any other note in our critical mass. It might be going through multiple subject notes, but at some level in your note hierarchy they should all be connected.

## 2 - Multisubject notes
We rarely learn something which is only useful in one subject/context, and the graph structure of the notes allows us to place them in multiple subjects and contexts. Following the first principle we wish to link our notes to all the subjects where it would be useful. How you do so is a personal preference, but having it in the top of the file allows quickly traversing up a subject tree.
When this is done well, you'll find yourself in a flow where looking for inspiration, for solutions to problems, ideas for new projects and papers, in your knowledge graph becomes almost effortless. That is at least the idea.
A common observation in your knowledge graph is that a lot of notes are clustered around/connected to an unimplemented note:
<span class="centerImg">![[UnimplementedClusterNoteExample.png|500]]</span>
This is usually a sign that you've built up an understanding of the unimplemented/[[Ghost notes|ghost note]] and is therefore able to implement it/make it.

## 3 - [[Ghost notes|Ghost links]]
When taking notes we often find ourselves referencing concepts which we might not have a full understanding of yet, and thus having a hard time implementing the current note. The best solution would of course be to first link to the concept, research it and implementing its note, then go back to the original note and continue. This however often lead to a rabbit hole, and is therefore not always feasible. Instead create a "Ghost" (due to the decreased opacity) link to the concept note, just at you would we an existing note. This will ensure that the context of the original note contains the ghost concept and that the ghost concept already is in the right context once it's created.

**Example:** *"If the matrices aren't square [[SVD - Singular Value Decomposition]] is used instead of PCA."*

## 4 - References
Reference your sources of the knowledge, and perhaps the broader context of the sources. In general it's nice to know where the knowledge comes from and how we were introduced to it, so we can reference it in papers and articles later on. Additionally it gives us the opportunity to verify our knowledge if it conflicts with newfound knowledge. Linking to sources also allows us to easily make overviews of courses and literature.
Where we reference these sources is up to the individual, but they're commonly placed in the bottom of the note.

# Linking types
**Subject links** are links from a note to its subjects, or from a [[MOC - Map Of Content]] to its underlying content/notes.

**Concept/Wiki links** are links embedded in text, which references a specific concept just like you'd see on wikipedia.

**Reference links** are links referring to the sources of the knowledge, like an article, course, movie and so on. Note that course material and the course itself can both be linked as references. This is generally preferable as it allows us to easily make overviews of courses while giving us a more concrete source of knowledge if needed.
