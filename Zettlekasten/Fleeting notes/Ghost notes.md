Ghost notes are simply non-implemented notes referred to by existing notes. Called ghost due to the decreased opacity of their links, e.g. [[Ghost note]].

Ghost clusters occurs when multiple notes refer to/reference the same ghost note. A ghost cluster indicates that you already know a significant amount about the concept of the ghost note, and thus you should be able to almost effortlessly implement it.
**Example:**
