Endergonic work requires you to continuously pour more and more energy into work to keep it going. Exergonic is the opposite: work that needs a start push and then gains momentum all by itself. 

Most of us have had to finish an assignment, having to force ourselves to do it. It's horrible. Maybe you've implemented a reward system, where you get a break after every section, as a short term solution. 
And most of us has also tried the feeling of not wanting to stop doing some work. Usually something that interests us. Which bring us into a cycle of positive feedback. 
This is where work is really done, and why nerds are awesome. Loving your work/studies/hobby brings you into this cycle, and let's you enjoy what other force themselves to do.
