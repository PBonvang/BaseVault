The Zettlekasten method/note system was invented by [[Niklas Luhmann]], with the simple purpose of making process of taking notes easier and the notes more useful. Zettlekasten is in short the process of taking [[Smart notes]].

# The system

The system at its core is simply two boxes: an idea and concept box ([[Permanent notes]]) and a bibliographic box (Library including [[Literature notes|literature]] and [[reference notes]]).
However it's usually accompanied by a [[slip box]], working as an inbox for new ideas and concepts aka. [[Fleeting notes]].

The brilliance of the system comes from the flexibility and freedom to connect notes to multiple topics, concepts and ideas. By making [[Atomic notes]] we can [[Note linking theory|connect]] and elaborate on our existing knowledge, in a well structured manner, which is what makes it easy to take notes.
The permanent notes doesn't have any strict hierarchy which you have to think about every time you make a note. "Where should this go, so I can find it again?"
In Zettlekasten you model your notes as a network of connected concepts, allowing you to traverse through your network to quickly find what you're looking for. Especially a Obsidian implementation of the Zettlekasten system will make it as easy as searching for the concept in the Quick Switcher and there you are. No scrolling through long files trying to find that formula. And no endless searching for the file containing that formula.
It might still happen that you find yourself unable to remember exactly what the concept is called, but you'll probably know what it's connected to. Great search for that and follow your network links, and you'll find the concept in no time.

# The principles
1. Use [[Fleeting notes]] to remember concepts short term, and transform them into [[Permanent notes]]
2. Use [[Literature notes]] to check your understanding/comprehension of the concepts introduced in the literature
3. Create [[Atomic notes]]/[[Permanent notes]], one note one concept or idea, and elaborate on your understanding
5. Simplicity is paramount. Don't make a huge complex system, which feels daunting to work with. Do what feels easy and works for you

# Psychological effects of the system
1. You're more likely to get into an [[Exergonic & endergonic workflow|exergonic workflow]], where you don't have to use [[Willpower is not fuel|willpower as your fuel]].
2. Increased comprehension using a system you trust and is personalized to you
3. It allows your brain to use external scaffolding, which has proven to be an extremely important skill for complex thoughts and analysis.
4. Small tasks done everyday makes the bigger task easy and fun. By making useful notes everyday writing papers, doing assignments and being creative becomes easy and fun, as most of the tasks are already done, you simply have to put some notes together, fill in the missing gaps by researching and making new notes, and voila. The permanent notes becomes your everyday tools, and the more you use it the better they get.
7. It trains you in extracting the relevant information of texts, which is the bread and butter for cognitive workers.
8. More effort increases your comprehension and understanding. This doesn't mean forcing yourself to write a lot of notes, but rather that the more effort you spend on something the better you get at it. From a brain perspective, using the same neural pathways many times over and over will increase the flow and accessibility to these pathways. This makes concepts and ideas which you often use (like taking smart notes) easier and easier to access and remember and therefore use.
9. Connecting and elaborating on new knowledge has the byproduct of learning, and inspiring you to seek and learn more
10. See your critical mass as assets, it's a concrete representation of your knowledge. Expanding it just a little everyday result in exponential growth in knowledge. Because you've taken the time to truly understand concepts, you'll have both increased your ability to learn and the ability to connect concepts others might not. Like stocks this follows [[Compounding interest]], having understood something properly the first time, and created notes which allows you to quickly relearn it, will make you faster and more creative everyday.
