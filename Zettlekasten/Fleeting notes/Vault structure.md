# Overview
**Plugins:** Contain plugin specific files. It makes the vault tidier having these "utility" files outside the core Zettlekasten.
- **Templater**
	- **Templates:** Contain templates/note blocks

**Zettlekasten:** [[Zettlekasten]] refers to the Zettlekasten note taking structure developed by [[Niklas Luhmann]] and contains all of your [[critical mass]].  Additional folders: Archive and Attachments. The Zettlekasten folders and their specific functions are described in [[Zettlekasten]].
- **Archive** is for files you're not using anymore, maybe because you've extracted the knowledge from the note into another note and don't find it useful anymore. Or because the knowledge in the file is outdated or useless to you now. This is what keeps your critical mass critical.
- **Attachments:** Contains your images, drawings and other non-reference attachments.
- [[Fleeting notes]]
- **Library:** Contains [[Literature notes|literature]] and [[Reference notes]]
- [[Permanent notes]]
- **Projects:** Contain project folders, with project specific files.
