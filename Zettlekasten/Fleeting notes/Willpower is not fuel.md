Having to force yourself to do your job, assignment or whatever else you should be doing but just can't seem to get done, is never really satisfying is it?

Beating your *feeling brain*, as Mark Manson describes it in [[Everything is fucked a book about hope]], into submission is not the answer. Creating a healthy relationship with yourself is, learning what really makes you happy, is perhaps really the only task worth doing.
Interesting, meaningful and most importantly well-defined tasks are rarely neglected.

**Studies show that willpower can only improve a little with training, so using it as the fuel to get through your day, won't get any better in the future. Find a better fuel source before you burn out.**
