Permanent notes are the bricks of your [[critical mass]], notes containing a core concept formatted in the your standard note format and connected to other permanent notes/your existing concepts. This is your knowledge base, where your understanding and knowledge resides.

A permanent note are created by combining and transforming one or more [[Fleeting notes|fleeting]] and [[Literature notes]] into one permanent note.

Note that fleeting notes can be created in the standard format, with your full understanding of the concept and be connected to existing concepts. What makes the difference between a permanent note and these notes are simply the placement. Once you put a note in the pile/folder of permanent notes it has becomes a permanent note and a part of your [[critical mass]]. Doing this should be done with consideration, polluting your critical mass will result in a useless mass, with concepts you don't understand and thus can't embed properly into your knowledge.

In this transformation it's encouraged to try to elaborate on the concept, trying to place it in new contexts and answer potential questions about the concept. Elaboration has proven the best way to take notes, for memorization and comprehension, as it deepens your understanding of the concept and embeds it in more of you're existing knowledge. 

Go through the check list before making a note a permanent note:
- [ ] Does it encapsulate your full knowledge and understanding of the concept?
- [ ] Is it connected to related notes and subjects?
- [ ] Does it follow the standard format?
- [ ] Does it reference the source of the knowledge?

If the note checks off every point on this list, it's a worthy permanent note and should thus be a permanent note.

Note that permanent notes aren't set in stone, but is continuously updated with new understandings of the concept. A fleeting or literature note can therefore update existing permanent notes.
