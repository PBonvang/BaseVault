Project notes, as the name suggests, are notes only relevant for a specific project. Project notes can be outlines, todo lists, drafts and other notes which doesn't directly explain a concept, contain an idea or is literature only relevant for the project.

It's encouraged to make projects in Obsidian and [[Zettlekasten]], but extract the gained knowledge into their own notes and archive the rest. It's a common mistake to let project notes flood/clutter your [[critical mass]]. As you very rarely reference project related notes, therefore they shouldn't be in your critical mass.

A practice I've implemented is keeping a project reference note, which I refer to in my critical mass.
