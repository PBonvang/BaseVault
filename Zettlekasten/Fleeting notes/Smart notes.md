The term "Smart notes" comes from DR. SÃ¶nke Ahrens' book [[How to take smart notes|How to take smart notes]] which builds on the [[Zettlekasten]] note taking system.
Smart notes are notes which help gaining a greater insight into your own understanding of concepts and their connections, providing a network of ideas and concepts readily available, resulting in effortless work. [[Niklas Luhmann]], the inventor of [[Zettlekasten]], said his work was effortless due to this system, which considering his accomplishments is astounding. 

The purpose of smart notes is to make useful, easily searchable and inspiring notes. See also [[How to take useful notes]].

# Context
There's no such thing as a Smart note, only collections of smart notes exist. The context of a note; What is its subject? Which concepts relate to this or could be combined with this? This context is just as important as the content, it's how new ideas and concepts are formed in your brain modelled in your notes, and what makes slapping together an article easy. This is how smart notes inspire you to write more, and thus learn more.
When building this network of concepts we often find that some ideas cluster around an unimplemented note. This means we already know a great deal about the content of this [[Ghost notes|ghost note]], it's thus almost effortless to implement this note. This is one of the powers of smart notes.
A note itself can thus not be smart as it doesn't have a context, rather the network of notes is what makes them collectively smart.

# Types
Smart notes comes in different forms/types with different purposes, together creating the network of smart notes.
- [[Fleeting notes]]
- [[Permanent notes]]
- [[MOC - Map Of Content]]
- [[Literature notes]]/[[Reference notes]]
- [[Project notes]]

# Standardization
Smart notes seek to have the same basic format/standard. Meaning general features of notes are located in the same place in all notes, e.g. references, subjects, tags, key formulas and so on.
Not every note fits the standard, especially different types of notes usually have their own formats/standards. It's still recommended to have features which all notes have in the same location, but specific type features should have their own standard locations and implementations.
The point is to make your notes as useful as possible, standardization makes the notes familiar which results in quick lookups of the information you need.
Or put differently it ensures that you can easily find what you're looking for in your notes, another power of smart notes.

To make this easy, it's highly recommended to make templates and use those. This will both significantly increase the speed of your note taking and make it easy to break big concepts into [[Atomic ideas]]/more specific concepts.
